# Booking Cancellation Prediction Analysis ðŸ“Š

### Project:
Build a predictive model to predict whether customers will cancel bookings and provide business insights.

## Steps:
- Analyze with business questions to strengthen business insights
- Conduct basic Exploratory data analysis
- Analyze features related to cancellations (e.g., booking time, length of stay, special requests)
- Conduct modeling using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree and XGBoost Classifier models with AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall and F1 Score metrics
- Conduct model interpretation to analyze features that affect whether or not a reservation is canceled.

### Business Value:
Hotels can reduce costs due to last-minute cancellations with better mitigation strategies (such as offering discounts or changing cancellation policies).
